                The recent wave of digitisation has created the foundation for a lot of tech startups and small size companies across Europe. The needs of these companies are very different from the enterprises and the solutions they require are also different. Sometimes, enterprise solutions employ dedicated staff just to implement and run a tool. However, the small and medium market companies need tools that can be up and running within a couple of weeks and need no extra resources to run them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The pandemic caused contrasting fortunes across the software industry. While some of them were discarded for cost optimisation, others  in digitising operations that were previously done in person. Personio plays such a role in the market.

            <p>
                Personio is the People Operating System for small and medium-sized companies with 10 to 2,000 employees. Personio’s mission is to make HR processes as efficient and effective as possible so HR can focus on what matters most: people. Personio does that by offering all-in-one HR software that includes human resources management, recruiting, talent management and payroll.
            </p>
            <p> 
               Personio is already impacting more than 10000 users daily across Europe. One of the biggest value propositions for 2022 is to increase this impact using people-workflow-automations. Helping users to be more efficient & infallible by connecting with all the tools that they use and act as the single source of truth for employee data.
            </p>
            <p>
               Personio now has more than 120 integrations with various applications. However, setting up some of these integrations isn’t an easy task, especially if the user isn’t a person with a technical background. This case study is about how I improved the life of an HR admin to discover and connect various integrations & maintain them easily and seamlessly.

                There are two types of integrations. 1P & 3P

            <p>
                 I joined as the Sr.Product designer for the integration tribe in Personio. This is one of the two tribes that contribute to the People-Workflow-Automation vision. Workflows being the other tribe. The integration team constitutes 3 technical & one strategic partner management team. I support two out of the three teams and work closely in collaboration with the third team as well as the Workflow tribe.

            <p>
                 I initiated and led the research for creating a tech-user persona, along with the UXR and PMs. I was involved in everything from  the recruitment of users to analysis of results to delivery & end to end execution. I designed the integration hub - a central place for all things integration.

        <div class="resp-desc">
            <p>
                 When I was hired in Q2 of 2022, Personio’s integration team was roughly about 4 years old. Personio, being an HR tool, was primarily built considering  an HR admin persona, supported by a supervisor and employee persona. For setting up and maintaining integration with other tools, an HR admin user almost always has to depend on an IT admin user. In spite of the team existing for 4 years, we were operating based on qualitative information acquired by various members of the team. We did not have a clear documented persona of an IT admin user, and that was exactly where I started my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                 There was a marketing persona for an IT admin but on further investigation, that proved to be not based on a lot of research. So i led a initiative along with UXR and PMs to document this.

                 Being the “new kid on the block”, I had little credibility and people didn’t have faith in the radical changes I proposed. As a result of this and some changes in the company's plans for H2 2022, no budget was allotted for this research. We (myself and the few people who believed in me) were asked to “make the best of what we have”. This added to one of the many challenges to recruitment.

                 Around this same time, I was reading about the Jobs to be done playbook by Jim Kalbach. So I was keen on putting this methodology into practice immediately. This, however, played to our advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Though we started off with an assumption that it's an IT admin that takes care of things on the tech side, we soon realised that this wasn’t the case. This purely depended on the company size, the product sector they were in and some other factors. While some companies had a dedicated IT team, others had the HR admin user wearing the hat of an IT admin to sort things out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 It didn’t matter what their roles were, we focused on their core jobs to be done in space and how we could improve them.

Further, to make all the research available across the company (100+ design team members), we uploaded them to Condens and tagged them against appropirate themes.

                <p>
                     Although we have 120+ integrations in the marketplace, the current integration activation process introduces multiple challenges that impede a smooth and user-friendly experience for integrations within the in-app Marketplace. The user has to navigate from the marketplace to the settings, fetch some information and then to the marketplace to complete the activation.

                </h4>
                <p>
                     Once setup, the integration is a dark-box. Usually it works like clockwork. They only know that something is not working after it is too late.

                     3. API Credential Management + Security
                </h4>
                <p>
                     For a custom integration, the users need a set of API credentials from Personio. Only HR has access to the creation process, but IT is the one creating the integration. Providing only the right set of permissions via API is needed for ensuring data security. Right now, control over this is very limited.
                </p>
                <h4>
                     4. Non-flexible integrations
                </h4>
                <p>
                     All of Personio’s integrations are hard coded. The user cannot customise any of these to fit into their specific use cases. Either they are forced to use them as it is or need to create a custom integration themselves.
                </p>
                <h4>
                     5. Using Out-of-the-box vs Building custom integrations
                </h4>
                <p>
                     Most companies don't have resources to build custom integrations. Exception: tech-savvy, larger companies that are in the software business themselves. These companies might even have dedicated teams who integrate the system landscape.

                <p>
                     Having a Sandbox before they can execute an integration before they actually expose it to the real data is preferred by almost all the users.

                     Automating manual tasks and processes is part of many IT people's job and is on the top of their minds. Manual processes are inefficient, time-consuming and error-prone. Users tend to use automation platforms in the absence of direct integration.

                     We could get a sense of the user’s feelings and the qualitative feedback from the insights. To put a solid case forward for a redesign, we needed to support the feedback with numbers. So we dug deeper into the data. We used Pendo for our in-app adoption analytics. Two things were clear from the data: there was a significant drop-off during the activation process.Activating an integration took over 7 minutes to complete.

                    I laid out all the information about a question in a table format where each question would be a separate line and a user can click on any question and it would expand to show more details of the question. Even though it was easy to scan through various questions, an accordion can hold very minimal. A question had a lot of parameters such as test cases, code checker parameters, etc, which could be overwhelming to showcase on an expanded view. This also makes it difficult to scroll if the question is big.

                    From a couple of customer calls, what we realised is that when a user is in a particular question’s context, they are not looking for anything else. So I designed a fly-out overlay that takes the user quickly into the details of the question (in a read-only mode) without taking them having to navigate away from the test listing’s context.

            A question was identified as one of the smallest independently existing entities in the evaluation system. Hence every existence of this entity should have a similar view. Based on this thought, I expanded the scope of the project to redesign the <strong>question library</strong> as well. It was a bonus pack for the dev team as we designed it in such a way that most components can be reused. This was picked up later on as a separate project.

                <p>A project with such a magnificent scale means that working in silos will prove to be ineffective. It’s always better to quickly walk up to a fellow engineer or a product manager to quickly resolve that confusion and avoid any assumptions</p>

                <p>While working with veterans and senior product owners, there will be chances that someone will debate with “in my opinion” statement. While some of these might be valid, most of them might not make any sense. In such situations, having sufficient customer support tickets and user research data is the only way to counter the “opinions” and bring up quality and usability</p>

                <p>Designing tiny elements without looking at the impact on the larger picture is not sustainable. On the contrary, if started with a holistic approach, the product development lifecycle will be smoother and efficient. Once the overall picture is plotted out, adding details to each becomes a cakewalk.</p>
