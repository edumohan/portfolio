                 The recent wave of digitisation has created the foundation for a lot of tech startups and small size companies across Europe. The needs of these companies are very different from the enterprises and the solutions they require are also different. Sometimes, enterprise solutions employ dedicated staff just to implement and run a tool. However, the small and medium market companies need tools that can be up and running within a couple of weeks and need no extra resources to run them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 The pandemic caused contrasting fortunes across the software industry. While some of them were discarded for cost optimisation, others  in digitising operations that were previously done in person. Personio plays such a role in the market.

            <p>
                 Personio is the People Operating System for small and medium-sized companies with 10 to 2,000 employees. Personio’s mission is to make HR processes as efficient and effective as possible so HR can focus on what matters most: people. Personio does that by offering all-in-one HR software that includes human resources management, recruiting, talent management and payroll.
            </p>
            <p> 
                 Personio is already impacting more than 10000 users daily across Europe. One of the biggest value propositions for 2022 is to increase this impact using people-workflow-automations. Helping users to be more efficient & infallible by connecting with all the tools that they use and act as the single source of truth for employee data.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Personio now has more than 120 integrations with various applications. However, setting up some of these integrations isn’t an easy task, especially if the user isn’t a person with a technical background. This case study is about how I improved the life of an HR admin to discover and connect various integrations & maintain them easily and seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p> 
                 There are two types of integrations. 1P & 3P

                 I joined as the Sr.Product designer for the integration tribe in Personio. This is one of the two tribes that contribute to the People-Workflow-Automation vision. Workflows being the other tribe. The integration team constitutes 3 technical & one strategic partner management team. I support two out of the three teams and work closely in collaboration with the third team as well as the Workflow tribe.

            <p>
                 I initiated and led the research for creating a tech-user persona, along with the UXR and PMs. I was involved in everything from  the recruitment of users to analysis of results to delivery & end to end execution. I designed the integration hub - a central place for all things integration.

            <p>
                 When I was hired in Q2 of 2022, Personio’s integration team was roughly about 4 years old. Personio, being an HR tool, was primarily built considering  an HR admin persona, supported by a supervisor and employee persona. For setting up and maintaining integration with other tools, an HR admin user almost always has to depend on an IT admin user. In spite of the team existing for 4 years, we were operating based on qualitative information acquired by various members of the team. We did not have a clear documented persona of an IT admin user, and that was exactly where I started my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                 There was a marketing persona for an IT admin but on further investigation, that proved to be not based on a lot of research. So i led a initiative along with UXR and PMs to document this.

            Being the “new kid on the block”, I had little credibility and people didn’t have faith in the radical changes I proposed. As a result of this and some changes in the company's plans for H2 2022, no budget was allotted for this research. We (myself and the few people who believed in me) were asked to “make the best of what we have”. This added to one of the many challenges to recruitment.

                    Though we started off with an assumption that it's an IT admin that takes care of things on the tech side, we soon realised that this wasn’t the case. This purely depended on the company size, the product sector they were in and some other factors. While some companies had a dedicated IT team, others had the HR admin user wearing the hat of an IT admin to sort things out.

                        Although we have 120+ integrations in the marketplace, the current integration activation process introduces multiple challenges that impede a smooth and user-friendly experience for integrations within the in-app Marketplace. The user has to navigate from the marketplace to the settings, fetch some information and then to the marketplace to complete the activation.

                        Once setup, the integration is a dark-box. Usually it works like clockwork. They only know that something is not working after it is too late.

                    <p>
                        For a custom integration, the users need a set of API credentials from Personio. Only HR has access to the creation process, but IT is the one creating the integration. Providing only the right set of permissions via API is needed for ensuring data security. Right now, control over this is very limited.

                        All of Personio’s integrations are hard coded. The user cannot customise any of these to fit into their specific use cases. Either they are forced to use them as it is or need to create a custom integration themselves.

                    We could get a sense of the user’s feelings and the qualitative feedback from the insights. To put a solid case forward for a redesign, we needed to support the feedback with numbers. So we dug deeper into the data. We used Pendo for our in-app adoption analytics. Two things were clear from the data: there was a significant drop-off during the activation process.Activating an integration took over 7 minutes to complete.

                    After streamlining the activation flow, we created an edit flow which is similar to the activation. Currently, there isn’t an option for the user to see their active integrations, so we also created a new space in the navigation which hosted everything related to integration in one place. This leads to two ideas:

                    While we could solve the Personio built integrations, the problem with customer-built integrations still exists. From the research & data, we identified that the users mostly created one set of API credentials with all permissions and reused them for each custom integration that they created. This poses a huge security risk.

                <p>
                    To avoid this, we are trying to provide the user with more of a sense of activating integration than rather just creating a credential. This will create a sense of 1:1 mapping for each tool they use and potentially reduce the risk of leak due to uncontrolled reuse.

            The marketplace in navigation will be replaced by the “Integration hub”. This will have a place for users to discover new integrations and activate them, view the details of all the connected integrations and update them. It will also provide easy access to the Personio developer portal.

                The new activation flow makes sure that the users need not navigate outside to complete the activation. Creation of a credential happens automatically in the background and is not surface in the UI. Hence, the user cannot reuse this credential. This improves the security of data.

                The review or manage mode is a translation of almost every step that the user went through at activation. However, there is no wizard involved. Hence, the user can come back and change any part of the settings anytime they wish to. API logs will also be provided after activation

                    The custom integration creation will also be a flow similar to activating the Personio built integration. This will also reduce the learning curve for the user. A view mode also provides a homogenous experience across both types of integration. We also provided the user with more granular access controls and API logs for even the custom-built integrations.

                    Alongside users who gave us the feedback, we also spoke to new participants who were from companies representing a range of company sizes with an emphasis on mid-market. Roles varied from HRIS Specialist, People Operations Manager, COO, HR Manager, to Managing Director. The users loved the updated navigation and the concept of land integration. All the users, including users who were used to the existing navigation loved intuitively navigating to the integration land.

                    After the user testing results came back positive, we needed to plan on how we were planning to roll it out in a controlled & progressive manner. The following is the current status of the transition. The numbers are already showing the impact.

                        1. In the first month of release, there was a noticeable increase in the successful completion of the activation flow. This figure surged from 27% to an impressive 31.88%.
