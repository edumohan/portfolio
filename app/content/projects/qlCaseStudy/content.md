                In India, the information technology industry has shown a steadily increasing trend since 1998. It never had a downfall and is still in its growth path even today. This also led to an increased number of developers being hired. However, the selection of a candidate for being hired into a software building company was mostly through campus hires and referrals.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has not been in favor of the employer because they might miss out on the right candidate as well as the candidate because he/she would have missed a good opportunity just because he was not from the tier 1 colleges. This is where HackerEarth intervenes to make both ends meet.

                HackerEarth provides various ways for the automated technical assessment of a candidate. There is a community front where an aspiring developer can learn and improve and there is a product that helps a recruiter technically assess a candidate. One of the main ways to do this is by creating a test and sending it to the candidate. Though HackerEarth was leading the Indian market by quite a margin and was one of the top three, the test creation was something a lot of users found to be complex. Let me take you through my journey of how I improved the recruiter’s experience by redesigned the test creation flow.

            <p>
                There are various ways to create a test. A test that is based on a job role, based on a job description, or based on skill. It is also possible for a user to create a test entirely from scratch. All tests have a test overview area where the settings of the tests could be changed and also a list of questions. How the questions are populated in that question list depends on how the test was created. Once the user reaches this part the user can tailor-make it exactly how he/she wants it. My role was to understand the user’s pain points and redesign the question listing for the test.

                As a product designer I had to do user research, competition analysis, create user flows, brainstorming with stakeholders and engineers involved to understand product architecture and impact areas. I also created high-fidelity iterations and development-ready designs. While the project was in development, I have worked closely with the front end team providing support and once development was completed, I was involved with the QA team for auditing and ensuring the intended experiences were delivered

                The product is used for technical hiring. This product leverages the core functionality of the platform to do a technical assessment. The primary user is a Talent Acquisition   Specialist(TA)

            <p>
                The TA’s primary responsibility is to source candidates to meet their hiring goals. They use different tools and databases to find candidates. Once potential candidates are identified they need to assess them on skills before they invest time in scheduling an onsite interview. They create a test with the help of a hiring manager. Once the test is created, it’s sent out to candidates.

                The system has a role-based access model. This enables different users to perform action and access information entitled to their role.

                    I applied the Gestalts principle of common religion and proximity. To do this, instead of grouping I changed the background colour to grey. This added more contrast between the cards and the background, which helped the user perceive each card as separate and all the cards that were closer to each other. This was well received by the users and the stakeholders. Different layouts were tried and tested.

                    I laid out all the information about a question in a table format where each question would be a separate line and a user can click on any question and it would expand to show more details of the question. Even though it was easy to scan through various questions, an accordion can hold very minimal. A question had a lot of parameters such as test cases, code checker parameters, etc, which could be overwhelming to showcase on an expanded view. This also makes it difficult to scroll if the question is big.

                <p class="no-margin ">
                    I decided to divide the question detail into 2 halves.

                    This also included the question’s analytics on how id was doing in the past.

                    From a couple of customer calls, what we realised is that when a user is in a particular question’s context, they are not looking for anything else. So I designed a fly-out overlay that takes the user quickly into the details of the question (in a read-only mode) without taking them having to navigate away from the test listing’s context.

            This quickly demonstrated value. There was a ton of information that was useful for the creator that surfaced as soon as the fly-out came into play. This information was otherwise inaccessible to the user. This info helped the user to choose a question better.

            The fly-out was extrapolated to serve more purposes like creating and editing a question. This added value for the user. Now the user with the right privileges can Create-View-Edit a question in the same view. For all the other users, it’s a perfect detail pane.

                    We did some AB testing with a few pilot customers who were part of our initial research. Various scenarios and tasks were given to the user to check if they were able to navigate through and accomplish their objectives.

            A question was identified as one of the smallest independently existing entities in the evaluation system. Hence every existence of this entity should have a similar view. Based on this thought, I expanded the scope of the project to redesign the <strong>question library</strong> as well. It was a bonus pack for the dev team as we designed it in such a way that most components can be reused. This was picked up later on as a separate project.
