It never had a downfall and is still in its growth path even today. This also led to an increased number of developers being hired. However, the selection of a candidate for being hired into a software building company was mostly through campus hires and referrals.</p>\n            <p>This has not been in favor of the employer because they might miss out on the right candidate as well as the candidate because he/she would have missed a good opportunity just because he was not from the tier 1 colleges. This is where HackerEarth intervenes to make both ends meet.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">Role of <br/> HackerEarth</div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>HackerEarth provides various ways for the automated technical assessment of a candidate. There is a community front where an aspiring developer can learn and improve and there is a product that helps a recruiter technically assess a candidate. One of the main ways to do this is by creating a test and sending it to the candidate. Though HackerEarth was leading the Indian market by quite a margin and was one of the top three, the test creation was something a lot of users found to be complex. Let me take you through my journey of how I improved the recruiter’s experience by redesigned the test creation flow.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">What I <br/>had to do?</div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>There are various ways to create a test. A test that is based on a job role, based on a job description, or based on skill. It is also possible for a user to create a test entirely from scratch. All tests have a test overview area where the settings of the tests could be changed and also a list of questions. How the questions are populated in that question list depends on how the test was created. Once the user reaches this part the user can tailor-make it exactly how he/she wants it. My role was to understand the user’s pain points and redesign the question listing for the test.</p>\n            <p>As a product designer I had to do user research, competition analysis, create user flows, brainstorming with stakeholders and engineers involved to understand product architecture and impact areas. I also created high-fidelity iterations and development-ready designs. While the project was in development, I have worked closely with the front end team providing support and once development was completed, I was involved with the QA team for auditing and ensuring the intended experiences were delivered</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">How did I <br/>go about it?</div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>The project was a major redesign, hence it was necessary to understand the current product and its users.

Even though it was easy to scan through various questions, an accordion can hold very minimal. A question had a lot of parameters such as test cases, code checker parameters, etc, which could be overwhelming to showcase on an expanded view.
