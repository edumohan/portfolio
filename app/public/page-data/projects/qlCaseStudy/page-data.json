It never had a downfall and is still in its growth path even today. This also led to an increased number of developers being hired. However, the selection of a candidate for being hired into a software building company was mostly through campus hires and referrals.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                This has not been in favor of the employer because they might miss out on the right candidate as well as the candidate because he/she would have missed a good opportunity just because he was not from the tier 1 colleges. This is where HackerEarth intervenes to make both ends meet.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            Role of <br/> HackerEarth\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                HackerEarth provides various ways for the automated technical assessment of a candidate. There is a community front where an aspiring developer can learn and improve and there is a product that helps a recruiter technically assess a candidate. One of the main ways to do this is by creating a test and sending it to the candidate. Though HackerEarth was leading the Indian market by quite a margin and was one of the top three, the test creation was something a lot of users found to be complex. Let me take you through my journey of how I improved the recruiter’s experience by redesigned the test creation flow.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            What I <br/>had to do?\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                There are various ways to create a test. A test that is based on a job role, based on a job description, or based on skill. It is also possible for a user to create a test entirely from scratch. All tests have a test overview area where the settings of the tests could be changed and also a list of questions. How the questions are populated in that question list depends on how the test was created. Once the user reaches this part the user can tailor-make it exactly how he/she wants it. My role was to understand the user’s pain points and redesign the question listing for the test.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                As a product designer I had to do user research, competition analysis, create user flows, brainstorming with stakeholders and engineers involved to understand product architecture and impact areas. I also created high-fidelity iterations and development-ready designs. While the project was in development, I have worked closely with the front end team providing support and once development was completed, I was involved with the QA team for auditing and ensuring the intended experiences were delivered\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            How did I <br/>go about it?\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                The project was a major redesign, hence it was necessary to understand the current product and its users.

They create a test with the help of a hiring manager. Once the test is created, it’s sent out to candidates.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                The system has a role-based access model.

Even though it was easy to scan through various questions, an accordion can hold very minimal. A question had a lot of parameters such as test cases, code checker parameters, etc, which could be overwhelming to showcase on an expanded view. This also makes it difficult to scroll if the question is big.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"no-margin \">\n                    I decided to divide the question detail into 2 halves.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"no-margin \">\n                    1.

So I designed a fly-out overlay that takes the user quickly into the details of the question (in a read-only mode) without taking them having to navigate away from the test listing’s context.\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"img-col-1 img-shadow  screeshot-wrapper\">\n                    <img src=\"/images/qlStudy/QLcasestudyhome.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe Image 2\"/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            See <br/>Everything\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step-description\">\n            This quickly demonstrated value. There was a ton of information that was useful for the creator that surfaced as soon as the fly-out came into play. This information was otherwise inaccessible to the user. This info helped the user to choose a question better.\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"img-col-1 img-shadow screeshot-wrapper no-top-margin\">\n        <img src=\"/images/qlStudy/Viewmode.gif\"  alt=\"wireframe Image 2\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            Make it <br/> Remake it\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step-description\">\n            The fly-out was extrapolated to serve more purposes like creating and editing a question.

For all the other users, it’s a perfect detail pane.\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"img-col-1 img-shadow screeshot-wrapper no-top-margin\">\n        <img src=\"/images/qlStudy/edit_view.gif\"  alt=\"wireframe Image 2\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            All Questions:<br/>Answered\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step-description\">\n            <div class=\"desc-row\">\n                <p>\n                    There were 16 types of questions.
