The needs of these companies are very different from the enterprises and the solutions they require are also different. Sometimes, enterprise solutions employ dedicated staff just to implement and run a tool. However, the small and medium market companies need tools that can be up and running within a couple of weeks and need no extra resources to run them. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n                 The pandemic caused contrasting fortunes across the software industry. While some of them were discarded for cost optimisation, others  in digitising operations that were previously done in person. Personio plays such a role in the market.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"resp-container\">\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n             Role of <br/> Personio\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                 Personio is the People Operating System for small and medium-sized companies with 10 to 2,000 employees. Personio’s mission is to make HR processes as efficient and effective as possible so HR can focus on what matters most: people. Personio does that by offering all-in-one HR software that includes human resources management, recruiting, talent management and payroll.\n            </p>\n            <p> \n                 Personio is already impacting more than 10000 users daily across Europe. One of the biggest value propositions for 2022 is to increase this impact using people-workflow-automations. Helping users to be more efficient & infallible by connecting with all the tools that they use and act as the single source of truth for employee data.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                 Personio now has more than 120 integrations with various applications. However, setting up some of these integrations isn’t an easy task, especially if the user isn’t a person with a technical background. This case study is about how I improved the life of an HR admin to discover and connect various integrations & maintain them easily and seamlessly.\n            </p>\n            <p> \n                 There are two types of integrations. 1P & 3P\n            </p>\n            <div style=\"display:flex\">\n              <div class=\"role-box grey-box\">\n                <div class=\"head\">1P</div>\n                <p>\n                  These are integration built by Personio, for a first party integration we have control over the activation process\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"role-box blue-box\">\n                  <div class=\"head\">3P</div>\n                  <p>\n                    These are integration built by the customers where Personio only provides the data via a controlled API access\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"resp-container\">\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n             What I <br/>had to do?\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                 I joined as the Sr.Product designer for the integration tribe in Personio. This is one of the two tribes that contribute to the People-Workflow-Automation vision. Workflows being the other tribe. The integration team constitutes 3 technical & one strategic partner management team. I support two out of the three teams and work closely in collaboration with the third team as well as the Workflow tribe.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                 I initiated and led the research for creating a tech-user persona, along with the UXR and PMs. I was involved in everything from  the recruitment of users to analysis of results to delivery & end to end execution. I designed the integration hub - a central place for all things integration.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"img-col-1\">\n                 <img src=\"/images/integrations/Roles.png\" alt=\"image about the roles that i played\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"resp-container\">\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n             The first question: <br/>Who is the user?  \n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                 When I was hired in Q2 of 2022, Personio’s integration team was roughly about 4 years old. Personio, being an HR tool, was primarily built considering  an HR admin persona, supported by a supervisor and employee persona. For setting up and maintaining integration with other tools, an HR admin user almost always has to depend on an IT admin user. In spite of the team existing for 4 years, we were operating based on qualitative information acquired by various members of the team. We did not have a clear documented persona of an IT admin user, and that was exactly where I started my journey.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                 There was a marketing persona for an IT admin but on further investigation, that proved to be not based on a lot of research. So i led a initiative along with UXR and PMs to document this.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"img-col-1\">\n                 <img src=\"/images/integrations/Who_is_user.png\" alt=\"A user persona doesn't exist, let us create one\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"resp-container\">\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            Recruitment <br/> challenges\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                 Being the “new kid on the block”, I had little credibility and people didn’t have faith in the radical changes I proposed. As a result of this and some changes in the company's plans for H2 2022, no budget was allotted for this research. We (myself and the few people who believed in me) were asked to “make the best of what we have”. This added to one of the many challenges to recruitment.\n            </p>\n           \n            <h5> Here goes the whole list </h5> \n            <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; padding-left:20px\">\n                <li>No budget</li>\n                <li>Legally a Personio employee is not allowed to contact any customer unless they explicitly allow us to do so</li>\n                <li>UXR was concerned of “over-using” the existing research pool.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br/>\n            <h5>\n                We regrouped, brainstormed for recruitment methods:\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n                1.
