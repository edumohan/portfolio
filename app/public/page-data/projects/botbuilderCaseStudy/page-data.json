Customers today demand the hyper-personalization of everything. When an understanding of customer preference, structured and unstructured customer data, conversations in and across all channels is leveraged, this personalization can be achieved. In the last 2 decades, BPO was synonymous with call centers. This is an outdated notion.

This meaning should be inferred by the system to provide the user with the right response.

What’s underlying this meaning is that the program understands the conversation with the human and decides what to speak next. However, in the case of blended experience, the agent subdivides his work to get all the standard workflows done using a linear flow which we call “Botlet”, for example, making a payment. \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/> The moment the term BOT is associated with it, there are a set of expectations that comes with it.

The user is told that the entire conversation is handled by a bot. All the blending happens behind the screens without letting the user know.\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>While the flow for methods 2 and 3 is straightforward, there could be variations for method 1 in terms of visual elements, interactions, etc. Telling the user that an agent is taking care of the whole thing while the bot takes care of the standard flows might not be possible as a law is coming into effect from June in California stating that any bot interactions have to be explicitly mentioned.\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"img-col-1\">\n                        <img \n                        src=\"/images/botbuilder/bb3.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe Image 1\"/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"space-block\"></div>\n    <div class=\"step-row\">\n        <div class=\"step-left\">\n            <h3>Product Design:<br/>Bot Builder </h3>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step-description\">\n            <div class=\"desc-row\">\n                <p>\n                    The objective of this is to standardize the conversation contained in the long run. To onboard a client and deploy an AIVA instance within minutes is the expected outcome. \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Every intent the visitor comes in with has a resolution. There could be multiple resolutions to each intent, but there is at least one. \n                    The conversation path which connects the intent-resolution pair could be different for even the same pair. This varies based mainly on two categories:\n                    <br/>Visitor’s profile & Bot’s Profile\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>The parameters that define the conversation can be made configurable such that for every intent-resolution pair, there exists a few variants of a standardized conversation.\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"img-col-1\">\n                        <img \n                        src=\"/images/botbuilder/bb4.png\" alt=\"wireframe Image 1\"/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"space-block\"></div>\n    <div class=\"step-row\">\n        <div class=\"step-left\">\n            <h3>Character<br/>of the bot</h3>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step-description\">\n            <div class=\"desc-row\">\n                <p>\n                    The configurable parameters make the bot behave in different ways for the same intent-resolution par. This means a user is essentially changing the character or the personality of the bot. The foundation of behavioural patterns is based on agent training. This also ensures that the agent and the bot provide a similar experience for the visitor.\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"img-col-1\">\n                        <img \n                        src=\"/images/botbuilder/bb5.png\" alt=\"wireframe Image 1\"/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"resp-container\">\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            <h3>What next?</h3>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n        The above-identified parameters can be converted into a UI. This will reduce the process of deployment of a bot from 4 weeks to a few hours. More parameters could be identified in the process of evolution to make the bot tailor-made to suit each client’s brand positioning and need.\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2076729562","3669895038","3682878853","3729204765"]}
