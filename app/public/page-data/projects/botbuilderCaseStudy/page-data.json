Customers today demand the hyper-personalization of everything. When an understanding of customer preference, structured and unstructured customer data, conversations in and across all channels is leveraged, this personalization can be achieved. In the last 2 decades, BPO was synonymous with call centers. This is an outdated notion. A huge chunk of BPO organizations has invested in new technologies to match the skill shortage.  \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            What is [24]7.ai\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                [24]7 is one of the world’s biggest players in customer support engagement and acquisition.

To onboard a client and deploy an AIVA instance within minutes is the expected outcome. \n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Every intent the visitor comes in with has a resolution. There could be multiple resolutions to each intent, but there is at least one. \n                The conversation path which connects the intent-resolution pair could be different for even the same pair. This varies based mainly on two categories:\n                <br/>\n                Visitor’s profile & Bot’s Profile\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The parameters that define the conversation can be made configurable such that for every intent-resolution pair, there exists a few variants of a standardized conversation.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"img-col-1 img-shadow\">\n                <img src=\"/images/botbuilder/bb4.png\" alt=\"wireframe Image 1\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"space-block\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            Character\n            <br/>\n            of the bot\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                The configurable parameters make the bot behave in different ways for the same intent-resolution par. This means a user is essentially changing the character or the personality of the bot. The foundation of behavioural patterns is based on agent training. This also ensures that the agent and the bot provide a similar experience for the visitor.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"img-col-1 img-shadow\">                        \n                <img src=\"/images/botbuilder/bb5.png\" alt=\"wireframe Image 1\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"resp-row\">\n        <div class=\"resp-title\">\n            What next?\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"resp-desc\">\n            <p>\n                The above-identified parameters can be converted into a UI. This will reduce the process of deployment of a bot from 4 weeks to a few hours. More parameters could be identified in the process of evolution to make the bot tailor-made to suit each client’s brand positioning and need.\n            </p> \n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2076729562","3669895038","3682878853","3729204765"]}
